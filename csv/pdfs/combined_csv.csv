0,pdfs\1.pdf,Previous work   The first protocol which dealt with the cluster based wireless sensor network was the leach protocol
1,pdfs\1.pdf,  The [leach] approach makes the communication in a wireless sensor network energy efficient by  involving the concept of threshold value  which is used to elect the cluster heads as per the number of  rounds
2,pdfs\1.pdf, The approach includes measuring the amount of residual energy in the nodes which will help  them to elect and re - elect the cluster heads
3,pdfs\1.pdf, The paper [cmpr] discusses about the centralized  clustering   approach to  provide the base station with most of the responsibilities which helps in  lower  the  energy consumption   by decreasing the latency and increasing throughput
4,pdfs\1.pdf, T he base station  generates the neighbour and  then elects the cluster heads an d forms the clusters as well
5,pdfs\1.pdf," As per any  network failure ,   the base station   is responsible to provide multiple paths which can be followed in  case of a failure which makes it more reliable than the previous approaches"
6,pdfs\1.pdf,   The paper [ sdn wsn survey ] proposes a   design of SDWS N  which  consists of sensor nodes i n data plane  and SDN controller   in the control plane
7,pdfs\1.pdf," Sensor nodes in data plane communicate wirelessly with each  other, and  can perform   data aggregation and fusion before communicating to utilize less energ y,  besides maintaining flow tables"
8,pdfs\1.pdf, The control plane devices are serially connected to the sensor nodes    
9,pdfs\1.pdf,  The contro l plane is logically centralized  instead of physically centralized
10,pdfs\1.pdf,     The paper  [ 1 ]   talks about the  proposed routing protocol by having the SDN layer in the application  and having the context and policy based routing approach 
11,pdfs\1.pdf," The protocol consists of 5 p hases, initiation  phase, topology discovery phase, decision phase, policy based routing phase and enforcement phase"
12,pdfs\1.pdf,  The scenario talks about having the control plane dealing with all the routing policies and the data  plane being the area where all the pol icies are implemented
13,pdfs\1.pdf," This lack a real life implementation and  the knowledge about the latency, packet delivery and quality of service"

0,pdfs\2.pdf,Activity:  Ar chi tecture Modeling  Importance   Understanding models and views that can capture an architecture is very  important  in software  architecture design
1,pdfs\2.pdf, Model views have to also be consistent among the different views
2,pdfs\2.pdf,   Learning Objectives    To  understand about common notations use d for architectural modeling that include the UML  and box and line drawings

11,pdfs\2.pdf, the  components are the ent ities in the sequence diagram and messages must be sent via  interfaces

14,pdfs\2.pdf, Read through the cash register requirements  posted  in Bl ackboard with this exercise and  using the n atural language notation write  descriptions of the components  envisioned in this  system
15,pdfs\2.pdf,  Note:  Components are similar to Classes  except that they may  consist of several  classes interacting through a common Interface
16,pdfs\2.pdf," As such  you can leverage t he noun -phrases  procedure typically used to extract Classes from a text ual  description of  a scenario,  where  nouns are u sed to define Classes"
17,pdfs\2.pdf, In a simila r fashion verbs in scenarios can help identify  communication  between components
18,pdfs\2.pdf,  3
19,pdfs\2.pdf, One could argue that creating a component diagram for the Cash Register system is a bit pre -mature an d as such  a UML Package diagram is  more suitable
20,pdfs\2.pdf,  Use the knowledge  acquired  from question 2 to create a UML Package  representation  of  the Cash Register system and  perceived  dependencies

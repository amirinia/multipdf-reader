0,pdfs\1.pdf,Previous work   The first protocol which dealt with the cluster based wireless sensor network was the leach protocol
1,pdfs\1.pdf,  The [leach] approach makes the communication in a wireless sensor network energy efficient by  involving the concept of threshold value  which is used to elect the cluster heads as per the number of  rounds
2,pdfs\1.pdf, The approach includes measuring the amount of residual energy in the nodes which will help  them to elect and re - elect the cluster heads
3,pdfs\1.pdf, The paper [cmpr] discusses about the centralized  clustering   approach to  provide the base station with most of the responsibilities which helps in  lower  the  energy consumption   by decreasing the latency and increasing throughput
4,pdfs\1.pdf, T he base station  generates the neighbour and  then elects the cluster heads an d forms the clusters as well
5,pdfs\1.pdf," As per any  network failure ,   the base station   is responsible to provide multiple paths which can be followed in  case of a failure which makes it more reliable than the previous approaches"
6,pdfs\1.pdf,   The paper [ sdn wsn survey ] proposes a   design of SDWS N  which  consists of sensor nodes i n data plane  and SDN controller   in the control plane
7,pdfs\1.pdf," Sensor nodes in data plane communicate wirelessly with each  other, and  can perform   data aggregation and fusion before communicating to utilize less energ y,  besides maintaining flow tables"
8,pdfs\1.pdf, The control plane devices are serially connected to the sensor nodes    
9,pdfs\1.pdf,  The contro l plane is logically centralized  instead of physically centralized
10,pdfs\1.pdf,     The paper  [ 1 ]   talks about the  proposed routing protocol by having the SDN layer in the application  and having the context and policy based routing approach 
11,pdfs\1.pdf," The protocol consists of 5 p hases, initiation  phase, topology discovery phase, decision phase, policy based routing phase and enforcement phase"
12,pdfs\1.pdf,  The scenario talks about having the control plane dealing with all the routing policies and the data  plane being the area where all the pol icies are implemented
13,pdfs\1.pdf," This lack a real life implementation and  the knowledge about the latency, packet delivery and quality of service"
